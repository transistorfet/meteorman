Meteor Games
============

###### *Started January 20, 2016*

Meteorman is a games website written using the Meteor framework for Node.js. It has blackjack, poker, rummy, and tile
rummy currently implemented. The games can be played with another human player, remotely, and there are provisions to
play with computer players, but no AI has been implemented so far. A fork of this project was partly converted to use
React for templates, instead of Blaze, but the conversion was not completed.
