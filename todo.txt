* implement the royal game of ur

* when you go to a specific game that you don't belong to, it still shows the page but without the data

* should you separate some stuff into a GameUtils library

* Make it so that only some of the logs are sent to the client, with a mechanism to fetch more logs if the user scrolls up

* add controls to change the cardsets in the game somehow
* add mechanism to join a game already in progress
* make it so when a player loses, they aren't booted from the game... maybe allow spectators?  or mark their player entry as 'out'?
* add support for avatars
